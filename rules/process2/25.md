1. **Check the `<storage_location_id>`:**
   - Verify the storage location ID provided in the error message.
   - Error Message: IDoc ID: `<idoc_id>`, Pollex ID: `<pollex_id>`, Description: Material `<material_id>` `<plant_id>` `<storage_location_id>` is not available.

2. **Decision Point:**
   - If `<storage_location_id>` is not equal to "0001":
     1. **Add storage location for material:**
        - Execute Transaction MMSC with parameters:
          - `material_id=<material_id>`
          - `storage_location_id=<storage_location_id>`
          - `plant=<plant_id>`
     2. **Reinitiate IDoc:**
        - Reinitiate the IDoc process.
   - Else (if `<storage_location_id>` is equal to "0001"):
     1. **Lock IDoc using transaction SA38:**
        - Execute Transaction SA38 with program `RC1_IDOC_SET_STATUS` and parameters:
          - `IDOC_ID: "<idoc_id>"`
          - `STATUS: "LKD"`
     2. **Send email to service provider:**
        - Email to `employee3@serviceprovider.com` with the message:
          - "Please cancel Pollex receipt with ID `<pollex_id>` and resend a new receipt."

3. **End of Process:**
   - The process concludes after executing the respective steps based on the decision point.
