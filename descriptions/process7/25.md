After receiving the necessary information, the LLM Agent begins by re-initializing the IDoc. This step is crucial for ensuring that the data is correctly processed and any previous errors are addressed. Once the IDoc is re-initialized, the process is complete. An email is then prepared to inform the relevant parties that the task has been completed, resolved, or released. This email typically includes the word "COMPLETE" followed by the old error message, which contains details such as the IDoc ID and Pollex ID, along with a description of the issue. This communication ensures that everyone involved is aware of the resolution and can proceed with their respective tasks.
