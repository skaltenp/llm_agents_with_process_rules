After receiving the necessary information, the LLM Agent begins by re-initializing the IDoc. This step is crucial for ensuring that the data is correctly processed and any previous errors are addressed. Once the IDoc is re-initialized, the process is complete. At this point, an email is typically sent out to notify relevant parties that the task has been completed, resolved, or released. This email includes the word "COMPLETE" followed by the old error message, which contains details such as the IDoc ID and Pollex ID, along with a description of the issue that was resolved. This communication ensures that everyone involved is aware of the status and details of the task, maintaining transparency and clarity in the process.
