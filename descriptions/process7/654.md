After receiving the necessary information, the LLM Agent takes action by re-initializing the IDoc. This step is crucial for ensuring that the data is correctly processed and any previous issues are resolved. Once the IDoc is re-initialized, the process concludes with the LLM Agent sending an email to notify relevant parties that the task has been completed. The email typically includes a message indicating that the task is "COMPLETE," along with the old error message details, such as the IDoc ID and Pollex ID, to provide context and confirmation of the resolution.
