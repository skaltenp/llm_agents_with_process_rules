After encountering an error message, the LLM Agent begins by retrieving the G/L accounts table using a function called "RFC_READ_TABLE." This function requires specific parameters: "TABLE_NAME" set to "GLACCOUNT_SCREEN_KEY" and "SAKNR" set to the G/L account ID. Once the table is obtained, the agent analyzes the entries to determine if there is exactly one company code entry for the G/L account.

If there is not exactly one company code entry, the agent sends an email to error.handler1@company.com. The email includes an error message with details such as the IDoc ID, Pollex ID, and a description stating that the G/L account is not provided for in the specified company code. The message also mentions the number of company codes in which the G/L account exists and requests assistance in handling the error.

On the other hand, if there is exactly one company code entry, the agent proceeds to update the IDoc number to reflect the company code of the G/L account. This involves setting the "PARTN" and "NAME1" fields of the "E1EDKA1" segment to the company code found in the retrieved table. Finally, the agent re-initializes the IDoc, completing the process.
