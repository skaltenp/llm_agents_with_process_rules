Once the error message is received, the LLM Agent begins by checking the current date. Following this, it retrieves the IDoc date from a specific segment and field, namely EDI_DC40 and CREDAT. With both dates in hand, the agent analyzes them to determine if the current date is the start of the month and if the IDoc date corresponds to the last day of the previous month.

If this condition is met, the agent proceeds to send an email to error.handler2@company.com. The email contains an error message detailing that the G/L account with a specific ID is blocked for posting in a particular company code. The message requests that the G/L account be unblocked for the current period to complete the IDoc process.

However, if the condition is not met, the agent sends a clarification email to error.handler1@company.com. This email also includes an error message, explaining that the G/L account is blocked for posting in the specified company code. The email requests clarification, noting that this is not a period error.

Through these steps, the LLM Agent ensures that the appropriate actions are taken based on the analysis of the dates and the specific conditions encountered.
