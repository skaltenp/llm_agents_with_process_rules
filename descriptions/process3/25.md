After encountering an error message, the LLM Agent begins by checking the current date. It then retrieves the date from the IDoc at segment EDI_DC40 and field CREDAT. With both dates in hand, the agent analyzes them to determine if the current date is the start of the month and the IDoc date is the last day of the previous month. If this condition is met, the agent sends an email to error.handler2@company.com. The email contains the error message, which includes the IDoc ID, Pollex ID, and a description stating that the G/L account is blocked for posting in a specific company code. The email requests that the G/L account be unblocked for the period to complete the IDoc.

If the condition is not met, the agent sends a clarification email to error.handler1@company.com. This email also includes the error message with the IDoc ID, Pollex ID, and a description of the issue. It asks for clarification, noting that the problem is not related to a period error. Through these steps, the LLM Agent effectively communicates the necessary information to the appropriate error handlers to resolve the issue.
