After encountering an error message, the LLM Agent begins by checking the current date. It then retrieves the IDoc date from a specific segment and field, EDI_DC40 and CREDAT, respectively. With both dates in hand, the agent analyzes them to determine if the current date is the start of the month and if the IDoc date corresponds to the last day of the previous month.

If this condition is met, the agent proceeds to send an email to error.handler2@company.com. The email contains an error message detailing that the G/L account with a specific ID is blocked for posting in a particular company code. The message requests that the G/L account be unblocked for the current period to complete the IDoc process.

However, if the condition is not met, the agent sends a clarification email to error.handler1@company.com. This email also includes an error message, but it specifically asks for clarification since the issue is not related to a period error. The message includes the IDoc ID, Pollex ID, and a description of the problem, which is that the G/L account is locked for posting in the specified company code.
