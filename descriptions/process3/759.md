After encountering an error message, the LLM Agent begins by checking the current date. It then retrieves the date from the IDoc at segment EDI_DC40 and field CREDAT. With both dates in hand, the agent analyzes them to determine if the current date is the start of the month and the IDoc date is the last day of the previous month. If this condition is met, the agent sends an email to error.handler2@company.com. The email contains an error message detailing that the G/L account with a specific ID is blocked for posting in a particular company code. The message requests that the G/L account be unblocked for the period to complete the IDoc.

If the condition is not met, the agent sends a clarification email to error.handler1@company.com. This email also includes an error message, explaining that the G/L account is blocked for posting in the specified company code and requests clarification since it is not a period error. The process continues based on the responses received from the respective error handlers.
