Once the error message is identified, the LLM Agent takes action to address the issue. The first step involves locking the IDoc using a specific transaction. This is done by executing the transaction SA38 with the program RC1_IDOC_SET_STATUS. The parameters for this function include "IDOC_ID" set to the specific IDoc ID and "STATUS" set to "LKD". This action ensures that the IDoc is locked and prevents further processing until the issue is resolved.

Following this, the LLM Agent sends an email to the service provider to notify them of the necessary actions. The email is addressed to employee3@serviceprovider.com and contains a request to cancel the Pollex receipt associated with the identified Pollex ID. The email also instructs the recipient to resend a new receipt to replace the canceled one. This communication ensures that the service provider is aware of the issue and can take the necessary steps to correct it.

By locking the IDoc and communicating with the service provider, the LLM Agent effectively manages the error, ensuring that the process can continue smoothly once the necessary corrections are made.
