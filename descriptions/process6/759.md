Once the error message is received, the LLM Agent takes action by locking the IDoc using a specific transaction. This involves executing the transaction SA38 with the program RC1_IDOC_SET_STATUS. The parameters for this function include "IDOC_ID" set to the specific IDoc ID and "STATUS" set to "LKD". After successfully locking the IDoc, the agent proceeds to communicate with the service provider. An email is sent to employee3@serviceprovider.com, requesting them to cancel the Pollex receipt with the given Pollex ID and to resend a new receipt. This email ensures that the service provider is aware of the necessary actions to rectify the issue.
