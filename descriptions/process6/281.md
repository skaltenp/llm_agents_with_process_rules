Once the error message is received, the LLM Agent takes action by locking the IDoc using a specific transaction. This involves executing the transaction SA38 with the program RC1_IDOC_SET_STATUS. The parameters for this program include the IDOC_ID, which is the unique identifier for the IDoc, and the STATUS, which is set to "LKD" to lock the IDoc.

After successfully locking the IDoc, the LLM Agent proceeds to send an email to a specific contact at the service provider. The email is addressed to employee3@serviceprovider.com, and it contains a request to cancel the Pollex receipt associated with a particular ID, referred to as <pollex_id>. The email also asks for a new receipt to be resent, ensuring that the process can continue smoothly without further issues.
