Once the error message is identified, the LLM Agent takes action to address the issue. The first step involves locking the IDoc using a specific transaction. This is done by executing the transaction SA38 with the program RC1_IDOC_SET_STATUS. The parameters for this function include "IDOC_ID" set to the specific IDoc ID and "STATUS" set to "LKD". This action ensures that the IDoc is locked and cannot be processed further until the issue is resolved.

Following this, the LLM Agent sends an email to the service provider to inform them of the necessary corrective actions. The email is addressed to employee3@serviceprovider.com, and it requests the cancellation of the Pollex receipt with the specified Pollex ID. The email also asks for a new receipt to be resent, ensuring that the process can continue smoothly once the issue is resolved. This communication is crucial for coordinating the next steps and ensuring that all parties are aware of the actions being taken to rectify the situation.
