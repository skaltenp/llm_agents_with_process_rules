After encountering an error message, the LLM Agent begins by analyzing the system status. Depending on the status, the agent takes different actions. If the system status is "CRTD," the agent proceeds to identify the person responsible using a robotic process automation (RPA) tool. This involves executing a transaction labeled "IW33" with the parameter "ORDER_NUMBER" to find the "PERSON_RESPONSIBLE."

Once the person responsible is identified, the agent retrieves their email address using a function called "RFC_READ_TABLE." The parameters for this function are "TABLE_NAME" set to "PUSER002" and "PUSER_ID" set to the identified "PERSON_RESPONSIBLE." With the email address in hand, the agent sends an email to the person responsible, requesting them to release the order. The email content reads, "Please release the order <order_number>. Answer this email when you have completed the release."

If the system status is "CLSD," the agent locks the IDoc using a transaction called "SA38" with the program "RC1_IDOC_SET_STATUS" and parameters "IDOC_ID" and "STATUS" set to "LKD." Following this, the agent sends an email to employee3@serviceprovider.com, asking them to cancel the Pollex receipt with the ID "<pollex_id>" and resend a new receipt.

For any other system status, the agent forwards the error message to the error handler. This message includes details such as the IDoc ID, Pollex ID, and a description of the system status, which is active for the order number. The email is sent to error.handler1@company.com with the content: "Error Message: IDoc ID: <idoc_id>, Pollex ID: <pollex_id>, Description: System status <system_status> is active (ORD <order_number>)."
