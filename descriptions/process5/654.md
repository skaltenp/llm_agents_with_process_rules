After encountering an error message, the LLM Agent begins by analyzing the system status. Depending on the status, the agent takes different actions. If the system status is "CRTD," the agent proceeds to identify the person responsible using an RPA tool. This involves executing a transaction labeled "IW33" with the parameter "ORDER_NUMBER" to find the "PERSON_RESPONSIBLE." Once the responsible person is identified, the agent retrieves their email address using the function "RFC_READ_TABLE," passing the parameters "TABLE_NAME" as "PUSER002" and "PUSER_ID" as the identified "PERSON_RESPONSIBLE."

With the email address in hand, the agent sends an email to the person responsible, asking them to release the order with the specified order number. The email requests that they reply once the release is complete.

If the system status is "CLSD," the agent locks the IDoc using transaction "SA38" with the program "RC1_IDOC_SET_STATUS" and parameters "IDOC_ID" and "STATUS" set to "LKD." Following this, the agent sends an email to employee3@serviceprovider.com, requesting the cancellation of the Pollex receipt with the given ID and asking for a new receipt to be sent.

For any other system status, the agent forwards the error message to Error Handler 1 by sending an email to error.handler1@company.com. The email includes the error message details: IDoc ID, Pollex ID, and a description of the active system status with the order number. This ensures that the error is handled manually by the appropriate team.
