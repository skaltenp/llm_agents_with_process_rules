After receiving the initial email, the LLM Agent takes action by re-initializing the IDoc. This step is crucial for ensuring that the data exchange process is reset and ready for further operations. Once the IDoc is re-initialized, the process concludes, and an email is sent out. This email contains information indicating that a task has been completed, resolved, or released. The content of the email typically includes the word "COMPLETE" followed by the old error message, which details the IDoc ID, Pollex ID, and a description of the issue that was addressed. This communication ensures that all relevant parties are informed about the resolution of the task.
