The process begins with the LLM Agent retrieving all storage locations from the SAP system. Once this information is gathered, the agent proceeds to collect all materials from these storage locations. With this data in hand, the agent searches for a specific material ID within the storage locations. If the material ID is found in any of the storage locations, the agent sets the storage location of the IDoc to the material's storage location. Following this, the IDoc is reinitialized, completing the process successfully.

However, if the material ID does not exist in any storage location, the agent takes a different path. It informs the error handler by sending an email to error.handler1@company.com. The email contains the message: "Material <material_id> does not exist in storage location." This ensures that the appropriate personnel are notified of the issue, allowing them to take corrective action. Throughout the process, the agent handles the tasks efficiently, ensuring that the necessary steps are taken based on the availability of the material ID in the storage locations.
